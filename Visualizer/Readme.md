# Visualizer Project with Qt, OpenGL, and C++

This project is a visualizer implemented using Qt, OpenGL, and C++ that enables the drawing of various curves and lines using different algorithms.

## Overview

The application allows users to perform the following operations:
- Add points in 3D space.
- Draw Bezier curves.
- Draw Hermite curves.
- Draw B-Spline curves.
- Draw lines using Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.
- Draw lines using Simple DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm.

## Features

- **Adding Points:** Users can input 3D points using X, Y, and Z values in the provided interface.
- **Bezier Curve:** Create Bezier curves by selecting four points.
- **Hermite Curve:** Draw Hermite curves by defining control points and tangent vectors.
- **B-Spline Curve:** Generate B-Spline curves using specified control points and a degree value.
- **Line Drawing:** Draw lines using Bresenham's algorithm or Simple DDA.

## Instructions

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Build the Application:** Use Qt Creator or an IDE supporting Qt projects to build the application.

3. **Run the Application:** Execute the built application to open the visualizer.

### Usage

- **Adding Points:** Input X, Y, and Z values for the desired points and click 'ADD'.
- **Bezier Curve:** Use the 'Bezier Curve' button to draw Bezier curves.
- **Hermite Curve:** Utilize the 'Hermite Curve' button to create Hermite curves.
- **B-Spline Curve:** Click on 'BSpline' to generate B-Spline curves.
- **Line Drawing:** Use 'Bresenham' or 'Simple DDA' buttons for line drawing.
